# Average

This project is an issue-free project designed to average two numbers.  

###### Please report any freakin problems to Faris. He probably won't be able to fix them but it's still worth it.  

The code works by using the Scanner class to take in two different integers.  Those numbers are then averaged together using basic arithmetic.
